Research on How Blockchain Technology Can be Applied in Waste Management

Traditional Waste Management:

    The current waste management process still functions as it did 30 years ago.
    It is difficult to track due to the high volume of waste and the variety of processes used.
    The current recycling program has no incentives for participants.
